/*
A graph that has no cyclic structure in it is basically a tree ....
In tree the no of edges will always be one less than number of edges

Connected component ---> A component in gaph through which you can traverse to all the vertex in that component
These diffrent component are called  connected component 

There are directed graph in which you can traverse only in specific direction....
Now it can be cyclic or acyclic ...Non directed acyclic graph are simply a tree

In case of directed graph we call it strongly connected component... A component in which you caan move to
each and every vertex of that component is strongly connected cmponent

Manytime a whole graph who have some component together is known as forest

In a tree ,  any part that is also tree is known a subtree 

Nodes that doesn't have any childs are called Leaf Nodes

Depth ---> depth of node is defined as distance from root node
Height---> height of node is defined as longest path from any leaf node .....and we can only go up 

LCA ---> Lowest Common Ancestor
For any two node when we go up from them the first common parent is defined as LCA for that nodes....
