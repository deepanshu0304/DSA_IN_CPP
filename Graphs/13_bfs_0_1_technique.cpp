we will find shortest path among two nodes but weight of all edges will not be equal 
so proper theorem for this is djikstra but there is some special case 
like if given the weight of all edges is either 0 or 1 then we can use this approach 
here is how 

If edge is 1 we will do simple bfs but if it is 0 we will insert it in front instead of back
